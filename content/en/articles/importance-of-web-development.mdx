## What is Website Development?

As the name suggests, website development is the process of building a website from scratch. Website here refers to all the sites available on the internet.

Web development typically consists of research, planning, building, testing, and maintenance. Given its complexity, it is usually handled by large teams.

This team includes roles like Business Analyst, UX Researcher, UI/UX Designer, Web Developer, and Tester. Each role possesses a significant portion and duty in every step of the development.

## Why is Website Development Important?

Since it was first built or created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, web development has seen massive growth. By February 2023, the number of websites worldwide reached 1.13 billion.

This growth is proportional to the increasing number of internet users. Nowadays, website development is considered critical for supporting and enhancing all aspects of human life.

In business, it started as a promotion facility to help customers recognize a brand's products. Now, websites act as a medium for sales and transactions.

Beyond business, website development is also essential for social life, including social media, education, healthcare, and even the government sector.

## Benefits of Website Development

According to surveys, 95% of people will look at online reviews before deciding to purchase an item. Therefore, many business owners utilize websites for promotion or branding.

In addition to branding, here are other benefits of website development for a business:

### Better Customer Engagement
Websites help improve interactions with potential buyers. You can add features like chatbots, social media links, or subscriber forms to your business site.

### Enhanced Credibility
A business with an attractive, informative, and user-friendly website design can enhance credibility and trust in the brand.

### Increased Sales
Informative websites attract visitors and then convert them into customers, boosting the total sales and revenue.

### Competitive Advantage
In this digital era, all businesses are required to compete online. By utilizing website development, you can build a site that stands out from competitors.

## Differences Between Web Development and Web Design

Many people mistakenly assume that web development is the same as web design. However, they are distinct:

1. **Objective**: Web design focuses on user experience and aesthetics, while web development focuses on functionality using specialized programming code.
2. **Tools**: Web designers use Figma or Adobe Creative Suite. Developers use programming languages like PHP, Python, or Javascript.
3. **Output**: Web design produces image assets or mockups. Web development produces a functional, running website.

## Front-End Development vs. Back-End Development

Website development is divided into two main processes:

- **Front-End**: Building the visual aspects seen by users (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- **Back-End**: Building the overall functionality and logic behind the scenes (PHP, Python, Node.js).

These two parts work together to display information requested by the user. Front-end receives instructions, and back-end processes the data.
